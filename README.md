# Rice-leaf-disease-classification
This project develops a deep learning model to accurately classify common diseases in rice leaves from images. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, this end-to-end computer vision pipeline leverages transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 architecture to achieve high accuracy, aiding in the early detection and management of crop diseases.
